# Quickboot

Quickly switch project:
  - stop runing docker containers
  - switch to the right directory (with autocomplete)
  - start dev environment containers
  - print vscode commands to attach the running containers

Roadmap:
  - use the vscode:// url handler to directly launch vscode
  - attach direclty to the running containers instead of opening vscode in the development VM, then, open the right container via devcontainers
